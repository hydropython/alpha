AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) Data Analysis and Modeling Project
This project by AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) involves analyzing and modeling data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), A/B Hypothesis Testing, and Statistical Modeling. The goal is to extract valuable insights from the data, validate hypotheses, and build predictive models to enhance business decisions and strategies.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several folders and files:

data/: Contains the raw and processed data files used in the analysis.
scripts/: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and statistical modeling.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis, hypothesis testing, and model development.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Data
The data/ folder includes:

raw_data/: Original datasets for analysis.
processed_data/: Cleaned and preprocessed data files ready for analysis.
Ensure that the datasets are correctly placed in their respective folders before running the notebooks or scripts.

Scripts
The scripts/ folder contains Python scripts for:

Data Preprocessing: Scripts to handle data cleaning, feature extraction, and transformation.
Statistical Modeling: Scripts to build, train, and evaluate statistical models.
Key Scripts
data_preprocessing.py: Handles missing values, feature engineering, and data transformations.
statistical_modeling.py: Includes functions for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
Notebooks
The notebooks/ folder contains Jupyter notebooks for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Interactive analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.

eda_analysis.ipynb: Covers data loading, preprocessing, summary statistics, and visualizations.
A/B Hypothesis Testing: Evaluates the impact of changes through statistical tests.

ab_testing.ipynb: Includes data preparation, hypothesis testing, and result interpretation.
Statistical Modeling: Builds and evaluates predictive models.

statistical_modeling.ipynb: Features data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
